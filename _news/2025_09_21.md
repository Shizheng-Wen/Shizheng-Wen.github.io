<!-- {% details **Two papers accepted by NeurIPS 2025** ðŸŽ‰ %}

I'm excited to announce that our two papers have been accepted to **NeurIPS 2025**!

- [Geometry Aware Operator Transformer as an Efficient and Accurate Neural Surrogate for PDEs on Arbitrary Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18781)
- [RIGNO: A Graph-based framework for robust and accurate operator learning for PDEs on arbitrary domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19205)
