Hi! I'm Shizheng, a Master student at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. [Siddhartha Mishra](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mishra). [Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Shizheng_resume.pdf). My research focuses on applied and computational mathematics, with a particular interest in developing solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). I am passionate about advancing numerical methods and machine learning techniques for PDEs, including:

* Differentiable Programming for numerical methods in PDEs.
* Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and neural operators for PDE solutions.
* Large Multimodal PDE foundation models and their applications.

I received my bachelor’s degree at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/).  In the past, I’ve had the honor of working with [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) at Duke University, [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at NUAA, and [Prof. Hao Sun](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/haosun) at [RUC](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/).

PDEs are the language of natural science, governing everything from fluid dynamics to quantum mechanics. As an enthusiast of mathematics, physics, and biology, I love integrating multidisciplinary perspectives to tackle complex problems. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
