Hi! I'm Shizheng, a second-year Master student at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. [Siddhartha Mishra](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mishra). [Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Shizheng_resume.pdf). My research interests lie in the intersection of AI and scientific computing:

* Differentiable Programming: FEM/FVM/FDM - MD - DFT 
* Physics constrained Learning: Data - Model - Loss - Optimization
* AI for Science: Applied Physics/Mechanics/Mathematics

 I received my bachelor’s degree of Aerospace Engineering with highest honor at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/), where I worked on nanoscale heat transfer advised by [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I have visited Duke University, working with [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) on AI & Aerodynamics. Before coming to ETH, I conducted molecular simulations with [Prof. Wanlin Guo](https://ifs.nuaa.edu.cn/ifs/2021/1119/c16705a279074/page.htm) at the [IFS](https://ifs.nuaa.edu.cn/ifs/) and AI with [Prof. Hao Sun](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/haosun) at [GSAI](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm).

 I have a great passion for natural sciences and engineering technology. Over the past few years, I have been continuously accumulating knowledge in various fields (mathematics, physics, computer science, robotics, biology etc.). I am dedicated to using multidisciplinary thinking to solve problems in different fields. If you are interested in my background, feel free to contact me!
