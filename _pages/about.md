Hi! I'm Shizheng, a doctoral student in the research group of [Prof. Siddhartha Mishra](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mishra) at the [Seminar for Applied Mathematics (SAM)](https://math.ethz.ch/sam) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My research focuses on applied and computational mathematics, with a particular interest in developing solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). I am passionate about advancing numerical methods and machine learning techniques for PDEs, including:

* Neural operators and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for PDE solutions.
* Differentiable Programming for numerical methods in PDEs.
* Large PDE foundation models and their applications.

In the past, I’ve had the honor of working with [Prof. Earl Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) at Duke University, [Prof. Wanlin Guo](https://ifs.nuaa.edu.cn/ifs/2021/1119/c16705a279074/page.htm) and [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at NUAA.

PDEs are the language of natural science, governing everything from fluid dynamics to quantum mechanics. As an enthusiast of mathematics, physics, and biology, I love integrating multidisciplinary perspectives to tackle complex problems. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
